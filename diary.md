# Diary

Writing what I did and decided.

## Day 1. Jun 19.

* Set up project with Next.js and TypeScript. But as 8.1.0 doesn't have `d.ts` files. So, I decided to use 8.1.1-canary version.

## Day 2. Jun 20.

* Set up basic pages. 
* Decided to use other designs for the main page. 
  - Header and hero area with [Divisima](https://colorlib.com/preview/#divisima)
  - Items [Minishop](https://colorlib.com/preview/#minishop)
  - Subtitle [Modist](https://colorlib.com/preview/#modist)
  - Deal of the Month [Minishop]
  - Testimonial [Minishop]
  - Footer: Minishop + Divisima
* Decided not to use material-ui. The bundle is too big. [size](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@material-ui/styles@4.1.1). Compare [emotion's size](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@emotion/styled@10.0.12)
* Decided to use name beanovia. Got it from namelix.com.
* Made logo with brankmark.io.
* Created `Theme` type and applied it to my theme. 
* Applied Normalize.css by creating Normalize.tsx. 
* Designed Nav, Header.
* Applied NProgress.

## Day 3. Jun 21.

* Choose an image for the hero area. [this](https://unsplash.com/photos/iIAjbjXsVt4)
* Responsive UI for the header.
* [Prisma vs. Mongoose vs. Sequelize](https://www.npmtrends.com/mongoose-vs-prisma-vs-sequelize). Decided to use Mongoose. Because it's more popular. 
* Got interested in logging application. So I read [this article](https://stackify.com/microservice-logging/).
* Begin with Monolith. Because I don't know much about docker and kubernetes. But I want to refactor it to microservices some day. 
* Set up backend and users module. 
  - Learned that it is better to create module first and others later. 
  - When using mongoose and @InjectModel. The name you used in @InjectModel and forFeature should be same. If not, you'll see a message like  " Nest can't resolve dependencies of the UsersService (?). Please make sure that the argument at index [0] is available in the UsersModule context.". 
* When you use `type` as argument, you'll see "The type of Mutation must be Input" error message. 

## Day 4. Jun 22.

* Planned to implement next module: Client GraphQL
```markdown
Do not think about other possibilities like online-course shop. Focus on making clothing shop. 

Module Scope 

* GraphQL Client. 
* admin package and CRUD products. 
* Show products on frontend

Dashboard items

* KPIs -> yesterday. Revenue. Orders. New customer. 
* KPI graphs
* Activities

Admin Product CRUD

* Create: Products page -> Add new
* Update: Products page -> Click item
* Fill content: Name, description. availability. stock. images. size, images.
* Delete: don't delete it. Archive it. Only delete it if there is no order of this item. 

Editor design

* Left
  - Name
  - Images
  - Description
* Right
  - Update / State (Draft, Public, Unlisted, Archive)
  - Options: Color, Size, Availability.

First Goal: Big Example. 
```
* Created `d.ts` files for `graphql-react` and `next-graphql-react`. Interestingly, if there is no `@types`, you must simply write module without `import`s. If you add them, it doesn't work. 
* Set up code `admin` app with create-react-app and basic pages. 

# Jun 23

* Installed some libraries. As it's Sunday and I went to church, I didn't count this day. 

# Day 5. Jun 24

* Decided to create theme repo. Because theme values are used in both admin and frontend. 
  - `create-react-app` doesn't allow compilation outside 'src' file. So, I had to find way to transpile `.ts` files in theme repo. 
  - So, I had to use Visual Studio Code Build system. `Ctrl + Shift + B`
  - And set up my tsconfig.json. Copied create-react-app tsconfig.json and changed noEmit -> false, outDir -> "./dist", declaration -> "true" and removed "allowJs" and "isolatedModule". 
  - But it constantly showed an error: "JSX element type 'Flexbox' does not have any construct or call signatures." It is solved simply by adding react and @types/react to themes. 
* `create-react-app` [doesn't support `dart-sass` yet](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5282). Currently, [dart-sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) is the primary implementation of SASS. So, I wanted to use it rather than `node-sass`. So, I used yarn's alias feature like `yarn add node-sass@npm:sass`.
  - But the default package manager of lerna is `npm`. So, when I tried to add internal repo, it showed me `Invalid dependency type requested: alias` message. So, I added `"npmClient": "yarn",` to `lerna.json`. 

 # Day 6. Jun 25

* Using [lighten-color](https://pinetools.com/lighten-color) and [darken-color](https://pinetools.com/darken-color) pages to define colors. 
   - It's a useful idea to define light and dark color of each color in theme. 
* [Box shadow tool](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) to create box shadow for buttons. 
* Followed [tutorial](https://gist.github.com/rimatla/a5a2c5dcf831c5744a656cfe81fadf52) and set up tslint to all packages. 
  - When tslint doesn't work properly, 1) type lint command and check if it works correctly, 2) close and reopen VS Code. 
* `yarn upgrade --latest` updates package.json file. 
* Added basic table skeleton.
