# Diary

Writing what I did and decided.

## Day 1. Jun 19.

* Set up project with Next.js and TypeScript. But as 8.1.0 doesn't have `d.ts` files. So, I decided to use 8.1.1-canary version.

## Day 2. Jun 20.

* Set up basic pages. 
* Decided to use other designs for the main page. 
  - Header and hero area with [Divisima](https://colorlib.com/preview/#divisima)
  - Items [Minishop](https://colorlib.com/preview/#minishop)
  - Subtitle [Modist](https://colorlib.com/preview/#modist)
  - Deal of the Month [Minishop]
  - Testimonial [Minishop]
  - Footer: Minishop + Divisima
* Decided not to use material-ui. The bundle is too big. [size](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@material-ui/styles@4.1.1). Compare [emotion's size](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@emotion/styled@10.0.12)
* Decided to use name beanovia. Got it from namelix.com.
* Made logo with brankmark.io.
* Created `Theme` type and applied it to my theme. 
* Applied Normalize.css by creating Normalize.tsx. 
* Designed Nav, Header.
* Applied NProgress.

## Day 3. Jun 21.

* Choose an image for the hero area. [this](https://unsplash.com/photos/iIAjbjXsVt4)
* Responsive UI for the header.
* [Prisma vs. Mongoose vs. Sequelize](https://www.npmtrends.com/mongoose-vs-prisma-vs-sequelize). Decided to use Mongoose. Because it's more popular.
